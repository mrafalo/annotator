## Annotator options

The system comes with the following options (buttons):

Select folder containing images. This version supports only PNG image format.

### Prev/Next

Show previous/next image from selected folder.

### Remove

Remove all annoatations from selected image.

### Save

Save all annatations defined for images in selected folder. This button produces following files (*FOLDER* - means selected folder name, *BASE* - means original image filename without extension):

* `FOLDER_baza.csv` - csv file that contains all annotations for images in selected folder
* `/annotations/out_shape_BASE.png` - original image with annoation
* `/out/rec.from_shape_BASE.png` - image containing only selected region. If region is defined by rectangle then this image contains region defined by this rectangle. If region is defined by points, then this image contains a rectangle that describes this shape.

### Load

Loads csv file containing annotations, connected with selected folder.

### Detect

### Rectangle/Point selector

## Current known limitations

1. The program only exports data to PNG format
2. Exported files have fixed names and hardcoded structure
